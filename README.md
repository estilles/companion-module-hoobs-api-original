# companion-module-hoobs-api

This module provides control over smart home accessories registered with a local [HOOBS](https://hoobs.org/) instance. HOOBS is based on Homebridge. Homebridge is a lightweight NodeJS server that emulates the iOS HomeKit API. Homebridge allows you to integrate with smart home devices that do not support the HomeKit protocol.

## Configuration
While you can use an existing HOOBS user to configure **companion-module-hoobs-api**, we suggest creating a new user for exclusive use with this module with the mininum permissions possible. 

> The HOOBS user used with this module DOES NOT require terminal access.

To configure this module you will need:

1. The hostname of your HOOBS instance (usually `hoobs.local`)
1. The TCP port of your HOOBS instance (usuall 80)
1. A set of credentials (username and password) to access your HOOBS instance.

## Supported Version
The module supports and has been tested with the latest HOOBS version.
